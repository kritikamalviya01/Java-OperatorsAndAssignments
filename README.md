# Java-OperatorsAndAssignments

1. Unary Operator :
        a. Increment -> ++
                Pre Increment -> x = ++y
                Post Increment -> x = y++
        b. Decrement -> --
                Pre Decrement -> x = --y
                Post Decrement -> x = y--
2. Arithmatic Operator :  +, -, *, /, %
3. Only operator that is overloaded in java is "+"
        Eg: 10+20 = 30
        Eg: "xy" + "ab" = xyab
4. Comparison Operator : < <= > >= == !=
5. Bitwise Operator :  -> performance slow, evaluate both, applicable for both integral and boolean
                      & -> if both the value is true
                      | -> if any of the value is true
                      ^ -> if both the values are different
6. Short Circuit Operator -> && || -> performance improvement, ignore 2nd value, Boolean only
7. Assignment operator: = , a += b;
8. Ternary Operator:  expression ? value1 : value2
